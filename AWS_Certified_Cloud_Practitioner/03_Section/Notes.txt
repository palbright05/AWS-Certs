        Notes Section 3 What is cloud computing 

Traditional IT Overview
    How websites work
        Client -> Network -> Server 
        Client and Server both find each other via there IP address
    What is in a server 
        CPU -> computations, processing 
        Memory -> RAM store info quickly 
            CPU and Memory together make a brain 
        Storage -> Long term storage, files 
        Database -> Store data in a more structured way, access via queries 
        Network -> Routers, switch, DNS server 

    IT Terminology 
        Network: cables, routers and servers connecgted with each other 
        Router: networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet
        Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network 

    Traditional infrastructure 
        We host webserver at our house in our garage 
        We have more demand for our website so we add more servers in our home 
        Company has more demand so we move to an office and create special room for servers called a data center 
            We scale by purchasing more and more servers 

    Problems with traditional IT approach 
        Pay for the rent for the data center 
        Pay for power, cooling and maintainance 
        Add or replace hardware takes time 
        Scaling is limited 
        Hire 24/7 team
        How to deal with disaster 

        We can externalize this with the cloud. 

What is cloud computing

    Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources 
    Through cloud service platform you get pay-as-you-go pricing 
    You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need 
    You can access as many resources as you need instantly
    Good gui to access services 

    Deployment Models of the Cloud
        Private Cloud
            Cloud services used by a single organization not exposed to the public
            Complete control
            Meet specific business needs
        Public Cloud
            Providers -> Azure, Google cloud, AWS 
            Cloud resources owned and operated by 3rd party cloud service provider delivered over the internet 
        Hybrid Cloud
            Keep some server on premises and extedn capabiliteis to the cloud 
            Control over private infrastructure 
            Flexible cost-effectiveness 

    Characteristics of Cloud Computing 
        On-demand self service
        Broad network access 
        Multi-tenancy and resource pooling 
        Rapid elasticity and scalability 
        Measured service 

    Advantages of Cloud Computing 
        Trade capital expense for operational expense
            Dont own hardware, pay on demand 
            Reduce total cost of ownership and operational expense  
        Benefit from massive economies of scale
            Prices reduced as AWS gets bigger because they become more efficient 
        Stop guessing capacity
            Scale based on actual usage 
        Increase speed and agility 
        Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers 
        Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure


The different types of cloud computing
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
        Provide building blocks for cloud IT 
        Provide networking computers, data storage space
        Highest level of flexibility 
        Easy parallel with on premis IT 
    Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        Remove teh need for org to manage underlying infrastructure
        Focus on the deployment and management of your applications 
    Software as a Service (SaaS)
        Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider 

    Things to manage: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking 

    On-premises -> Everything is managed by you 
    IaaS -> You manage: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS 
    PaaS -> You manage: Applications, Data
    SaaS -> you manage: Nothing

    IaaS -> Amazon EC2
    PaaS -> Elastic Beanstalk
    SaaS -> Many Rekognition for machine learning 

    Pricing Model 
        AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals following the pay as you go pricing 
        Compute:
            Pay for compute time
        Storage:
            Pay for the data stored in the cloud
        Data transfer OUT of the Cloud:
            Data transfer in is free


AWS Cloud Overview 
    AWS is Global 
        Region 
        Avalability Zone 
            ap-southeast-2a 2b 2c 
        Local Zone 
        Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
            Content delivered with low latency 

    AWS has global services 
    Most AWS services are Region-scoped
