    Notes Section 4 IAM - Identity and Access Management 

Introduction
    IAM (Users & Groups) -> Identity and Access Management 
        Global Service
        Create User and assign to group
        When we create an account we create root User
        Create users and groups -> Groups only contain users not other groups 
        User can belong to multiple groups 

    Why do we create users and groups 
        We want to allow certain access (permissions)
        Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies 
        These policies define permissions of the users 
        In AWS we apply the least priveledge prinicple: dont give more permission that a user needs 

Users and Groups Hands on 
    Tags -> allow you to give meta data 
    Can log in with IAM user
        acct id -> aws-nikko
        name -> Nikko 
        pw -> userNikko1u42380028384082

Multi Session Support
    Click User Name (top right)
        Select Turn on multi session Support

IAM Policies 
    Policies get attached at the group level
    Users inhert access from groups 
    Inline policy is a policy only attached to the user 

    Policy Structure
        Note: * in AWS mean any/all  (Get*, List*)
        JSON documents 
            Version #
            ID 
            Statement (required)
                SID -> identifier for the statement (optioanl, "1")
                Effect: Whether the statement allow or deny access ("Allow")
                Principal: account/user/role 
                Action: List of actions this policy allows or denies
                Resource: list of resources to which the action s applied to 
                Condition: Condition on when this policy is in effect (optional)

    MFA Overview 
        Password Policy     
            Strong passwords -> higher security for your account 
            In AWS you can setup a password policy   
                Min len, lower case letter
                Change after 90 days 
                Prevent reuse 
            Multi Factor Authentication MFA
                You want to protect root account and IAM Users
                MFA = password you know + security device you own
            MFA device options in AWS 
                Virtual MFA device (Google Auth, Authy)
                Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key

    MFA Hands On 
        You download and sign up with a MFA app on your iPhone. 
        When you login to AWS you check the code on the app and then you can enter that into the AWS site and login.
        Similar to 2FA with a text just done via an app
