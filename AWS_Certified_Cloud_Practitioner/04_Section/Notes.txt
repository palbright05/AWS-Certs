    Notes Section 4 IAM - Identity and Access Management 

Introduction
    IAM (Users & Groups) -> Identity and Access Management 
        Global Service
        Create User and assign to group
        When we create an account we create root User
        Create users and groups -> Groups only contain users not other groups 
        User can belong to multiple groups 

    Why do we create users and groups 
        We want to allow certain access (permissions)
        Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies 
        These policies define permissions of the users 
        In AWS we apply the least priveledge prinicple: dont give more permission that a user needs 

Users and Groups Hands on
